# Craigslist-Web-Scraper
Searches craigslist for items based on the region and item phrase inputted and returns a list of prices, date of post, link, and title in a table format. 

Note: This application is not finished and could use better commenting and better user input validation. Future additions to this project could include postings from other places like amazon and ebay. All work is my own except for a 4-5 lines that set up the image for the label tag that uses the search png to set up a banner for the application.
